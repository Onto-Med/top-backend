# TOP Backend

Spring Boot based backend of the TOP framework. Please see [top-deployment](https://onto-med.github.io/top-deployment)
for additional documentation.

[![Lint and Test](https://github.com/Onto-Med/top-backend/actions/workflows/lint-and-test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Onto-Med/top-backend/actions/workflows/lint-and-test.yml)

## Running the Spring Server

1. Set up environment variables:
    * `APP_PORT`: the port where the spring application will run on, e.g. 8080
    * `APP_PATH`: the context path, e.g. "/" for root
    * `DB_TYPE`: type of the DB to be used, defaults to postgresql
    * `DB_HOST`: host running the database server, defaults to localhost
    * `DB_NAME`: name of the database, defaults to postgres
    * `DB_PORT`: port of the database host, defaults to 5432
    * `DB_USER`: username for connecting to the database, defaults to postgres
    * `DB_PASS`: password for connecting to the database, required
    * `DATA_SOURCE_CONFIG_DIR`: location of data source configuration files, defaults to `config/data_sources`
    * `DOCUMENT_DATA_SOURCE_CONFIG_DIR`: location of document data source configuration files, defaults to `config/data_sources/nlp`
    * `QUERY_RESULT_DIR`: location where query results are stored to, defaults to `config/query_results`
    * `QUERY_RESULT_DOWNLOAD_ENABLED`: whether users with write permission for a repository can download query results
      or not, defaults to true
    * `TERMINOLOGY_SERVICE_ENDPOINT`: endpoint of the Ontology Lookup Service to be used for code search, default
      to http://localhost:9000/api (OLS3 is currently supported)  

   Document related:  
   *(The following variables will be overwritten by their respective adapter values if specified)*  
    * `DB_NEO4J_USER`: username for neo4j database, defaults to `neo4j`
    * `DB_NEO4J_PASS`: password for neo4j database (should be declared here and not written into an adapter)
    * `DB_ELASTIC_USER`: username for elasticsearch database, defaults to `elastic`
    * `DB_ELASTIC_PASS`: password for elasticsearch database (should be declared here and not written into an adapter)

   *(These are general configuration variables for the database that won't be declared in an adapter)*  
    * `DB_ELASTIC_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT`: timeout in seconds, defaults to `1s`
    * `DB_ELASTIC_SOCKET_TIMEOUT`: timeout in seconds, defaults to `30s`
    * `DB_NEO4J_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT`: timeout in seconds, defaults to `30s`  

   OAuth2 related:
    * `OAUTH2_ENABLED`: enable or disable oauth2, defaults to `false`
    * `OAUTH2_URL`: base URL of the OAuth2 server, defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:8081`
    * `OAUTH2_REALM`: name of the OAuth2 realm to be used for authentication
2. Start the PostgreSQL database ([see dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres)). Please review the documentation
   for production use.
    ```sh
    docker run --rm -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password postgres
    ```
3. Start the Neo4J database ([see dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/_/neo4j)). Please review the documentation for
   production use.
    ```sh
    docker run --rm -p 7687:7687 -e NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/password neo4j
    ```
4. Start a default document index service (Elasticsearch) on the address specified in the adapter (if no adapter file is found defaults to `localhost:9008`).

5. Start the [concept graphs service](https://github.com/Onto-Med/concept-graphs) on the address specified in the adapter (if no adapter file is found defaults to `localhost:9007`).

6. Start the OAuth2 server ([see dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/keycloak)).

If you run the TOP Framework with an OAuth2 server, the first user that is created will have the admin role.

## NLP/Document related configuration

To utilize the document search of the framework, one needs three different services running: 
1. Elasticsearch or something similar (default: `http://localhost:9008`)
2. A Neo4j cluster (default: `bolt://localhost:7687`)
3. And the [concept graphs service](https://github.com/Onto-Med/concept-graphs) (default: `http://localhost:9007`)

The document search is adapter centric and one needs a working configuration file (yml) that specifies the addresses of said services
under the folder declared with the environment variable `DOCUMENT_DATA_SOURCE_CONFIG_DIR`.
If no `DOCUMENT_DEFAULT_ADAPTER` is specified, the first adapter found in the folder is used for setup.  
If there is no such adapter present, or it's faulty in some other way, the framework uses default values for the connections (specified above).

## Plugins

Any plugin you want to provide must be a member of the package `care.smith.top`.
It is sufficient to build JAR files and place them in the classpath of this application.

Please make sure to set all TOP Framework dependencies in your plugins to `provided`! e.g.:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>care.smith.top</groupId>
        <artifactId>top-api</artifactId>
        <version>${version}</version>
        <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

Currently supported plugin types:

* **phenotype importer:** implement `care.smith.top.top_phenotypic_query.converter.PhenotypeImporter`
* **phenotype exporter:** implement `care.smith.top.top_phenotypic_query.converter.PhenotypeExporter`

## Development

### Coding Standard

The code in this repository, and in contributions provided via pull requests, should conform
to [Google Java Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).

We use the flag `--skip-reflowing-long-strings` for [google-java-format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format),
as it is currently not supported by all IDEs.

### Database Migrations

The application uses [Liquibase](https://www.liquibase.org) in combination with
[liquibase-maven-plugin](https://docs.liquibase.com/tools-integrations/maven/home.html) to manage migrations (changelog
files).

This section describes how to generate new changelogs based on modifications applied to JPA entities.
To generate new changelogs, a local HSQL database is used to reflect the state prior to changes.

1. Run `mvn liquibase:update` to apply all changelogs to the local HSQL database.
2. Make desired modifications to the JPA entities in `care.smith.top.backend.model`.
3. Recompile all JPA entities with `mvn compile`.
4. Run the following command to generate new changelogs:
   ```sh
   mvn liquibase:diff \
     -Dliquibase.diffChangeLogFile=src/main/resources/db/changelog/changesets/<timestamp>-<changelog name>.yaml
   ```
   You can call `set user.name=<change author>` before above command to modify the changelog author name.
5. Review the generated changelog file!

*There is a bug in `liquibase-maven-plugin` that results in recreation of some constraints and of the hibernate
sequence.
You should manually remove these changes from the generated changelog file.*

### NLP related Tests

On newer JDK versions, you might need the following arguments to run Neo4j tests:  
`--add-opens java.base/java.nio=ALL-UNNAMED`
`--add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED`

### Docker

Before building the Docker image, copy `.env.dist` to `.env` and fill in your GitHub username and Maven package registry authentication token.
